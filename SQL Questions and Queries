FROM bood_bank.data 
GROUP BY State
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;


3 - List the State and respective count of blood bank, wherin the number of blood bank is less than 30.And order that in descending order by count of bloodbank.

SELECT State,count(*) as Less_than_30_blood_bank FROM bood_bank.data
group by State
having count(*) < 30
order by count(*) desc


4- List the Name of blood bank and create a column as Is_Government where if the blood bank is government then Yes or else no.

With CTE as (
 SELECT Blood_Bank_Name,
       CASE WHEN Blood_Component_Available = 'YES' and Apheresis = 'YES' and (Service_Time = '24X7' or Service_Time = '24x7' or Service_Time = '24 hrs') 
            THEN 'Full_Service' 
            ELSE 'Partial_service'
       END as Full_or_partial
 FROM bood_bank.data)
Select Blood_Bank_Name,Full_or_partial
from CTE
WHERE Full_or_partial = 'Full_Service';


6- Query the number of blood bank in each states where the name of the state starts with A?

SELECT State,Count(*) FROM bood_bank.data
WHERE State like 'A%'
group by State;


7- Query the number of bloodbanks in each district, with full service capablity(blood bank with blood_component_availiblity as YES and Aphresis as YES and service time as 24x7 or 24 hrs or 24X7).
.

With CTE as ( 
 SELECT Blood_Bank_Name,District,
       CASE WHEN Blood_Component_Available = 'YES' and Apheresis = 'YES' and (Service_Time = '24X7' or Service_Time = '24x7' or Service_Time = '24 hrs') 
            THEN 'Full_Service' 
            ELSE 'Partial_service'
       END as Full_or_partial
 FROM bood_bank.data)
SELECT District,Count(Full_or_partial) as Full_service_blood_bank
from CTE
where full_or_partial = 'Full_Service'
group by District
order by Count(Full_or_partial) desc;


8- List the Name of states and count of blood bank,which has Blood_component_available as yes and service_time is either 24x7 or 24X7,also order by descending order by their respective count,and also rank them.

With CTE as (

 where Blood_Component_Available = 'YES' and (Service_Time = '24x7' or Service_Time = '24X7')
 group by State
 order by count(*) desc)
SELECT State,Blood_bank_With_both_condition,dense_rank() over(order by Blood_bank_With_both_condition desc) as Rank_of_count_of_number_of_blood_bank
from CTE;
